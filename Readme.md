# Thermal Printer Hello World

![demo](readme_attachments/demo.gif)

This is a really quick and simple hello world using the adafruit thermal receipt printer.

I'm going to use this printer in the final version of the Pegasus plinko machine, so I wanted a quick proof of concept to work out printing a xbm image off of an external trigger (in this case, a button, in the final version, a different microcontroller).
